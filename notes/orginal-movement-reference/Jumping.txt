__NOTOC__
Jumping is an essential mechanic that is quite self-explanatory.



== Activation == <!--T:2-->

<!--T:3-->
To start a jump, the player must have been on ground the previous [[Special:MyLanguage/Ticks|tick]]. This is why the player is able to run off a block for 1 tick (e.g. with a [[Special:MyLanguage/Timings|headhitter timing]]) and still be able to jump.

<!--T:4-->
When the Jump key is held, the player jumps at most once every 10 ticks (0.5s)

<!--T:5-->
* Holding jump is not optimal when going up by more than 0.75b per jump. (consequence: towering is faster when jumping manually)
* Releasing jump resets the cooldown, making the player able to jump again on the next tick.

<!--T:6-->
When a jump is initiated, the player's vertical speed is set to 0.42. On every following tick, it is decreased by 0.08 (gravity), then multiplied by 0.98 (drag).

<!--T:7-->
* When the player hits a ceiling, their vertical speed is set to 0 and they immediately start falling.
* When the player hits the ground, their vertical speed is set to 0 and the <code>onGround</code> flag is set as true.
Jumping in [[Special:MyLanguage/Water and Lava|water or lava]] makes the player move upward.



== Jump Height == <!--T:8-->

<!--T:9-->
Prior to 1.9, the maximum jump height is '''1.249b'''. It is increased in 1.9+ by ~0.003b, making the player able to jump '''1.252b''' high.

<!--T:10-->
On flat ground, a jump lasts '''12 [[Special:MyLanguage/ticks|ticks]]''' (0.6s).



== Speed == <!--T:11-->

<!--T:12-->
When combined with [[Special:MyLanguage/Sprinting|Sprinting]], jumping adds 0.2 units of acceleration towards the player's facing.

<!--T:13-->
In air, the player accelerates less quickly (only 20% of the base acceleration value), but conserves more speed (91% every tick, instead of 54.6%).

<!--T:14-->
Therefore, sprint-jumping is a very efficient way to build and conserve speed.



== Code == <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
The following snippets of code deal with how jump is activated.<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
/* From EntityLivingBase.java, stripped of irrelevant code */
public void onLivingUpdate()
{
    if (this.jumpTicks > 0)
        --this.jumpTicks;

    <!--T:17-->
if (this.isJumping)
    {
        if (this.isInWater())
            this.handleJumpWater(); //motionY += 0.04

        <!--T:18-->
else if (this.isInLava())
            this.handleJumpLava();  //motionY += 0.04

        <!--T:19-->
else if (this.onGround && this.jumpTicks == 0)
        {
                this.jump();
                this.jumpTicks = 10;
        }
    }

    <!--T:20-->
//releasing the jump key resets the 10 tick cooldown.
    else
        this.jumpTicks = 0;
}


<!--T:21-->
/* From EntityLivingBase.java */
protected void jump()
{
    this.motionY = 0.42; //Initial speed

    <!--T:22-->
//apply jump boost
    if (this.isPotionActive(Potion.jump))
        this.motionY += (this.getActivePotionEffect(Potion.jump).getAmplifier() + 1) * 0.1F;

    <!--T:23-->
//apply sprintjump boost
    if (this.isSprinting())
    {
        float f = this.rotationYaw * 0.017453292F; //multiply by pi/180 to convert to radians
        this.motionX -= MathHelper.sin(f) * 0.2F;
        this.motionZ += MathHelper.cos(f) * 0.2F;
    }
